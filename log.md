# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: Wednesday, April 29th 2020

**Today's Progress**: I spent a bunch of time figuring out how to work on my old projects with my new setup (Git and Oh My Zhs). Reviewed WTJ code to extract list of job openings. Spent a bunch of time trying to extract the JSON data in between script tags from the job description URL. Ended up posting on StackOverflow. Hopefully someone can help out with this otherwise I don't know how I'm going to move forward!

**Thoughts** Lots of time reviewing the work I did a couple of weeks ago, Googling and OverStackflowing, not a lot of time coding and no progress made as far as the project goes (ie still haven't cleared the roadblock to extract job description)

## Day 2: Thursday, April 30th 2020

**Today's Progress**: I made a lot of progress! 
* Learned how to use Node.js to navigate and fill out form on ameli.fr 
* Practiced using git commands to add projects that were started on local environment to GitHub repositories
* Reviewed feedback I got on StackOverflow. Didn't solve my problem but I learned more about asking the right questions and how to look for solutions online

**Thoughts** There's so much to learn! Great community that's super helpful but seems to be big opportunities for good teachers and people who enjoy solving problems for others.

## Day 3: Friday, May 1st 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
* Found a solution to my `<script type="application/ld+json">` scraping problem! It's a little bit dirty and not very elegant but it works! 
* Also worked on a new personal blog project using Ghost and Digital Ocean. 
* Struggled (a LOT!) with the push to GitHub :/
* TODO: Need to take the time to give feedback on StackOverflow: explain that proposed solution didn't work and share the work-around I found.

**Thoughts** So much exciting stuff to do. Feels like the #100DaysOfCode focus on only counting project time and not online courses or tutorials time really spurred me on. Feels like I haven't made this much progress since the 1 week sessions with VonStruddle :) Feel very focused and driven. Long may it last.

## Day 4: Saturday, May 2nd 2020

**Today's Progress**: Not much. Restarted personal blog project from scratch. Was working fine and then it wasn't :/

**Thoughts** Feels like no progress at all! Destroyed Digital Ocean droplet I had created last night and redid entire Ghost / Digital Ocean setup following tutorial. Worked fine for an hour or so and now site seems to be down even though I was only editing a post in the Ghost editor! Weird. Oh well, I'm giving up for the day. Don't want to spend the whole weekend on this.

## Day 5: Sunday, May 3rd 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
* Learned about media queries
* Practiced mobile-first design
* Learned about images being only element that's not responsive by default. Solution: set a `max-width: 100%;` so it doesn't stretch when screen is big and doesn't overflow when screen is small. 


**Thoughts** Was going to have a break today and ended up working on HTML/CSS any way. Hope I don't regret it tomorrow when I'm back in the office :/

## Day 6: Monday, May 4th 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
* Wrote a blog post about HTML being responsive by default
* Recorded a 30 second video to demonstrate
* Worked on perfect-job code 
* Tried to make it more elegant, taking into account Antoine's proposed solution
* Didn't work out. No progress made, no commit. 


**Thoughts** My code works. Time to move on to the next section in the program. Someday soon I'll have a lightbulb moment and figure out how to streamline the code. I'll have to remember to update my post on StackOverflow to pay it forward.

## Day 7: Tuesday, May 5th 2020

**Today's Progress at around 8pm**: First day no coding.


**Thoughts at around 8pm** A little disappointed because I love streaks but not annoyed with myself because I simply could not make the time for it today. Proud of myself for the work delivered on other projects ;)

**Today's Progress at 11:30pm**: 1 step forward, 4 steps back. Seem to have deleted all the new content I had created for new website....


**Thoughts at 11:30pm** I actually want to throw up. It's only a new blog but there are 3 posts in there that I really hope are not lost. The plan: get some sleep and come back wiser tomorrow.

**Today's Progress at 11:53pm**: YES!!!! I figured it out! Had activated the wrong instance of my Ghost installed. Managed to find the one with all the content and got it back up and running. Woooohoooo!


**Thoughts at 11:53pm** Relief, pride, joy.

## Day 8: Wednesday, May 6th 2020

**Today's Progress**: None. Didn't code today.

**Thoughts** Feel good about it. Needed the day off :) Goal for tomorrow: make progress on Perfect Job project. Specifically, work on adding job description to Google Sheets and formatting json so key: value pairs look good in GS

**Link(s) to work**


## Day 9: Thursday, May 7th 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
* Added function to look at spreadsheet and create a list with all the URLs already included
* Added function to compare list of URLs scraped in current session with URLs already added to spreadsheet
* Updated function to add new URLs to spreadsheet without deleting URLs from previous sessions

**Thoughts** Happy with the progress I'm making. Got to review a few basic concepts I had forgotten about like append to list! Program is getting a little dense and I'm sure can be streamlined but getting there little by little :)

## Day 10: Friday, May 8th 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
* Practiced working with Hunter.io's API
* Practiced teaching others how it works (consolidating my knowledge in the process)
* Practiced creating repository in Git and Github again

**Thoughts** Learning a lot by doing + teaching. It's incredibly easy to forget how you did it the first time + explaining how things work to others forces you to clarify your thoughts and understanding in the first place.

## Day 11: Saturday, May 9th 2020

**Today's Progress**:
* Practiced working in my Ubuntu server
* Learned about viewing and editing files 

**Thoughts** After my big scare on day 7, I've taken up the habit of reading through 2-3 tutorials before trying anything. This helps me: 
* understand the big picture of what I'm trying to do
* compare options and work out which one is the best for me 
* take the time to learn about concepts that are still unclear 

Basically, it helps me clarify my thoughts BEFORE getting stuck in the middle of a tutorial and blindly trying random commands because I can't back-track now! :)

## Day 12: Sunday, May 10th, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
* Automatically add date of scrape to Google Sheet when updating with new URLs
* Extracts job description + adds data in dedicated columns in Google Sheets

**Thoughts** Started out meaning to fix one minor thing (datetime), ended up pretty much wrapping up the script in much less time than expected! Still a few things to fix (keep going to next page if more than 2 page results) and streamline to make the code more readable (one task = one function)

After just 12 days into #100DaysOfCode, my first program is almost done. I had started it a few weeks before but wasn't working on it regularly despite watching tutorials and taking code "lessons" every day. Now I have something concrete that works and that I can show off to employers! :) 

Building things is clearly a very powerful way to learn.

## Day 13: Monday, May 11th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: recorded tutorial on how to use Hunter.io API (first of a three part series)

**Thoughts** It's definitely helped me clarify what APIs are for and how they work

## Day 15: Wednesday, May 13th, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
* practiced writing what my ideal job would look like in a Python script
* turns out I didn't use it because it didn't look good as a LinkedIn banner

**Thoughts** It was harder than I first imagined! Especially with no real data to test the validity of my code :/

## Day 16: Thursday, May 14th, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
* put browse launch into a function (don't need to comment in and out anymore when testing)
* used recursiveness and it worked!
* exceeded my Google API write request quota. A coming of age tale? :p

**Thoughts** Struggled on something that seemed easy from the outset (go through all pages of results, not just first two). Could have tested my code without pushing data to Google Sheets everytime. Would have saved me API requests ;)

## Day 17: Friday, May 15th, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
* fixed code to respect Google API limits
* worked on handling exceptions for automating navigation and interaction with Apolearn platform (tried a few things but no real progress so far)
* created new repository in GitHub for Apolearn project

**Thoughts** A good night's sleep and a programming session in the morning can work wonders: solved this little hiccup in seconds when, although solution seemed clear last night, foggy brain wasn't confidence of fixing it on the spot and worried about messing up the rest. For one line of code!

For the handling exceptions thing, might want to takes 20-30 minutes to take a step back and think about the problem on paper

## Day 18: Saturday, May 16th, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
* reviewed code to call GET requests of Hunter API on a list of contacts hard-coded in the script
* recorded part 2 of Hunter API tutorial (reviewed code from previous tutorial + coded and explained second section of the script)

**Thoughts** It only took 1 take this time around (compared to 3-4 for part 1). Partly because there was more standard Python and less API so I was more comfortable but also because my understanding of API requests improved when I recorded that first tutorial. Definitely scary to put myself out there like this but worth it, if only to improve my own understanding and learning skills!

## Day 19: Sunday, May 17th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
* reviewed code to authenticate myself as Google account user in Python
* reviewed code to get and push data from and to a Google Sheet workbook in Google Drive 
* updated and tested code for part 3 of the tutorial on how to work with the Hunter.io API

**Thoughts** Never hurts to review these things. Still don't quite understand the Google API documentation. In this case specifically, found a YouTube tutorial more helpful to follow along and then deconstruct and understand what we've been up to. I guess little by little I'll get a better sense of what to look for in more obscure API documentations :)

## Day 20: Monday, May 18th, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
* created new Scrapy project
* reviewed command line, virtual environments and Scrapy installation
* got a better understanding of how Scrapy works (items, middlewares, pipelines and spiders)

**Thoughts** Still a lot to learn and today was mostly theoretical and getting to grips with concepts but really enjoying how things I used to find very confusing are not so confusing anymore :)

## Day 21: Tuesday, May 19th, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
* learned more about Scrapy
* followed along tutorial, applied on my machine and took notes

**Thoughts** It's a lot of information to process and I'm tired so not a super productive day in terms of building things but I am making progress. At this stage, it feels necessary since I need to understand the foundations of how Scrapy works before I can do anything remotely interesting with it. Plan is to rest a little bit tomorrow and Thursday, focus on reinforcing my understanding of XPATH, CSS selectors, etc. and get back to building things on Friday.

## Day 22: Wednesday, May 20th, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
* learned more about XPATHs
* discussed coding collaboration opportunities to keep each other motivated with fellow growth hacker 

**Thoughts** It's pretty dense material. Have difficulty staying focused for long on the subject so trying to consume it in small increments, making sure I'm taking notes, testing things and understanding along the way. Hoping the Scrapy course gets more hands on fast because, although reviewing CSS selectors and learning about XPATHs is important, I need to be building real stuff to practice and feel like it's worth the effort.

Nothing to show for this


## Day 23: Thursday, May 21st, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
* reviewed process to create Service Account Key in Google API
* updated and tested code for part 3 of the tutorial on how to work with the Hunter.io API
* made sure script works even when Hunter.io doesn't find an email (ie response is not 200)

**Thoughts** Posting the first video 2 weeks ago and committing to one new video a week for 3 weeks was a good move. Probably wouldn't have gone through with these tutorials otherwise because it requires effort and there was no urgency to review my work (I knew I could do it afterall). It's been enjoyable and good practice.

## Day 24: Friday, May 22nd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
* reviewed process to create Service Account Key in Google API while recording take 1 of Hunter API tutorial
* fixed Aposcrape script to play videos properly (solve selenium.common.exceptions.ElementNotVisibleException)


**Thoughts** Video tutorial ran a bit long (34 minutes). Think I can probably clarify my thinking a little bit and record another take that explains stuff better. Goal is not just to show people how to do it (take 1 did that fine) but to explain things clearly along the way so people watching understand the logic and know WHY they're doing what they're doing. Even though each API is different and may use modules with different methods, explaining the logic of one is helpful in other situations.

## Day 25: Saturday, May 23nd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: None really. Pushed a commit to GitHub but that's about it :)


**Thoughts** Feels good to relax!

None today.


## Day 26: Sunday, May 24th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
* Recorded video tutorial explaining how Google APIs work (Drive and Sheets)
* Learned how to backup my Ghost blog on the server and [how to save backup folder to local drive](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28390798/copy-folder-from-server-to-local-machine-in-ubuntu)

## Day 27: Monday, May 25th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: No progress. Focused all of my energy on job search. 


**Thoughts** It paid off, got the offer, yey!

## Day 28: Tuesday, May 26th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Not much. Just watched short video tutorial about XPATH fundamentals.


**Thoughts** Feeling relieved but tired after 3 months job search finally paid off. My brain needs the rest. I'll be taking it easy in the next few days.

## Day 29: Wednesday, May 27th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learning how to move up tree with XPATH

**Thoughts** Tutorials are not as fun as building projects but a necessary "evil" to get a high-level understanding of stuff

## Day 30: Thursday, May 28th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
* learned how to move down tree with XPATH 
* practiced launching scrapy crawl in virtual environment


**Thoughts** Tutorials are not as fun as building projects but a necessary "evil" to get a high-level understanding of stuff + good to follow along, rewind and deconstruct along the way

## Day 33: Sunday, May 31st, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
* watched and coded along a couple of Scrapy tutorials 

**Thoughts** Less incentive to work on my sideproject related to job search since I found a job. Will get back to it in due course but it feels good to take foot off the gas after 4-7 months at full throttle.

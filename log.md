# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: Wednesday, April 29th 2020

**Today's Progress**: I spent a bunch of time figuring out how to work on my old projects with my new setup (Git and Oh My Zhs). Reviewed WTJ code to extract list of job openings. Spent a bunch of time trying to extract the JSON data in between script tags from the job description URL. Ended up posting on StackOverflow. Hopefully someone can help out with this otherwise I don't know how I'm going to move forward!

**Thoughts** Lots of time reviewing the work I did a couple of weeks ago, Googling and OverStackflowing, not a lot of time coding and no progress made as far as the project goes (ie still haven't cleared the roadblock to extract job description)

## Day 2: Thursday, April 30th 2020

**Today's Progress**: I made a lot of progress! 
* Learned how to use Node.js to navigate and fill out form on ameli.fr 
* Practiced using git commands to add projects that were started on local environment to GitHub repositories
* Reviewed feedback I got on StackOverflow. Didn't solve my problem but I learned more about asking the right questions and how to look for solutions online

**Thoughts** There's so much to learn! Great community that's super helpful but seems to be big opportunities for good teachers and people who enjoy solving problems for others.

## Day 3: Friday, May 1st 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
* Found a solution to my `<script type="application/ld+json">` scraping problem! It's a little bit dirty and not very elegant but it works! 
* Also worked on a new personal blog project using Ghost and Digital Ocean. 
* Struggled (a LOT!) with the push to GitHub :/
* TODO: Need to take the time to give feedback on StackOverflow: explain that proposed solution didn't work and share the work-around I found.

**Thoughts** So much exciting stuff to do. Feels like the #100DaysOfCode focus on only counting project time and not online courses or tutorials time really spurred me on. Feels like I haven't made this much progress since the 1 week sessions with VonStruddle :) Feel very focused and driven. Long may it last.

## Day 4: Saturday, May 2nd 2020

**Today's Progress**: Not much. Restarted personal blog project from scratch. Was working fine and then it wasn't :/

**Thoughts** Feels like no progress at all! Destroyed Digital Ocean droplet I had created last night and redid entire Ghost / Digital Ocean setup following tutorial. Worked fine for an hour or so and now site seems to be down even though I was only editing a post in the Ghost editor! Weird. Oh well, I'm giving up for the day. Don't want to spend the whole weekend on this.

## Day 5: Sunday, May 3rd 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
* Learned about media queries
* Practiced mobile-first design
* Learned about images being only element that's not responsive by default. Solution: set a `max-width: 100%;` so it doesn't stretch when screen is big and doesn't overflow when screen is small. 


**Thoughts** Was going to have a break today and ended up working on HTML/CSS any way. Hope I don't regret it tomorrow when I'm back in the office :/

## Day 6: Monday, May 4th 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
* Wrote a blog post about HTML being responsive by default
* Recorded a 30 second video to demonstrate
* Worked on perfect-job code 
* Tried to make it more elegant, taking into account Antoine's proposed solution
* Didn't work out. No progress made, no commit. 


**Thoughts** My code works. Time to move on to the next section in the program. Someday soon I'll have a lightbulb moment and figure out how to streamline the code. I'll have to remember to update my post on StackOverflow to pay it forward.

## Day 7: Tuesday, May 5th 2020

**Today's Progress at around 8pm**: First day no coding.


**Thoughts at around 8pm** A little disappointed because I love streaks but not annoyed with myself because I simply could not make the time for it today. Proud of myself for the work delivered on other projects ;)

**Today's Progress at 11:30pm**: 1 step forward, 4 steps back. Seem to have deleted all the new content I had created for new website....


**Thoughts at 11:30pm** I actually want to throw up. It's only a new blog but there are 3 posts in there that I really hope are not lost. The plan: get some sleep and come back wiser tomorrow.

**Today's Progress at 11:53pm**: YES!!!! I figured it out! Had activated the wrong instance of my Ghost installed. Managed to find the one with all the content and got it back up and running. Woooohoooo!


**Thoughts at 11:53pm** Relief, pride, joy.

## Day 8: Wednesday, May 6th 2020

**Today's Progress**: None. Didn't code today.

**Thoughts** Feel good about it. Needed the day off :) Goal for tomorrow: make progress on Perfect Job project. Specifically, work on adding job description to Google Sheets and formatting json so key: value pairs look good in GS

## Day 9: Thursday, May 7th 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
* Added function to look at spreadsheet and create a list with all the URLs already included
* Added function to compare list of URLs scraped in current session with URLs already added to spreadsheet
* Updated function to add new URLs to spreadsheet without deleting URLs from previous sessions

**Thoughts** Happy with the progress I'm making. Got to review a few basic concepts I had forgotten about like append to list! Program is getting a little dense and I'm sure can be streamlined but getting there little by little :)

## Day 10: Friday, May 8th 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
* Practiced working with Hunter.io's API
* Practiced teaching others how it works (consolidating my knowledge in the process)
* Practiced creating repository in Git and Github again

**Thoughts** Learning a lot by doing + teaching. It's incredibly easy to forget how you did it the first time + explaining how things work to others forces you to clarify your thoughts and understanding in the first place.

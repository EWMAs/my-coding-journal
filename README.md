# #100DaysOfCode challenge
I decided to participate in the #100DaysOfCode Challenge and created this repository to log updates to my coding journal along the way.

## Want to learn more about the #100DaysofCode challenge?
Check out [kallaway's repository] (https://github.com/EWMAs/my-coding-journal.git)

## Why am I not just using a fork of that repository to log my entries?
Well... Github doesn't count commits to fork repositories and I wanted a simple way to track my streak even when I'm not working on a project that warrants a GitHub repo.
